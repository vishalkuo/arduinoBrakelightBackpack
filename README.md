# arduinoBrakelightBackpack

## About
The BrakeLight backpack is a wearable project intended to make biking a safer and more enjoyable experience. Esentially, the wearer can indicate the direction he wishes to turn by pushing a button on his bike handle. The backpack will then light up with the corresponding arrow to let traffic behind him know. Additionally, the built in accelerometer will detect when the user is slowing down and will have the entire backpack light up. This project was created using arduino and flora microcontrollers along with Adafruit parts.
